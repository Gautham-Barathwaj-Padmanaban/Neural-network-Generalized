# Neural-network-Generalized
An attempt to create a code that allows the user to perform classification analyses using a neural network. The code aims to allow the user to choose the number of layers of network and the number of nodes per layer the user wants to choose. Back-propagation with regularization has been implemented.   Current issue - optimization using scipy.optimize. TNC seems to be giving erratic results and I am not able to implement BFGS or other learning algorithms due to array shape errors.
